# hfhe
Experimental version of the FHE library on hypergraphs.

This library is experimental and serves as an academic reference implementation of HFHE (Homomorphic Fully Homomorphic Encryption) on hypergraphs. It is intended for experimentation and testing purposes only, cannot be used in production versions, and should be substantially expanded. The library is used to demonstrate the capability of performing mathematical operations on ciphertexts.
